            &emsp;Current curricula teaches either data-oriented programming,
            theoretical notions of STEM or isolated instances of mechanical
            handling of devices. We strive at bridging the gap and develop
            complex skills in our trainees that will include aspects from
            engineering - IT - science in a complex pattern that ultimately
            increases motivation for the study of STEM subjects and a better
            insertion on the labour market. Students design an embedded system
            in a flipped classroom environment. Project team members gather all
            data (input) and design the first module of the curricula focused on
            the design, engineering of a microcontroller application. IO1 is
            structured on engineering. The elements of innovation are the
            special blend of skills (both transversal and basic ) in VET
            students which are the focus of this IO and the means to achieve it
            through the joint effort of specialists in engineering -IT-
            sciences. The method is also innovative for it is through flipped
            classroom techniques that students arrive at theoretical data. In
            teams with coordinating teachers and under the guidance of an
            industry specialist they have to build devices which use embedded
            systems. A lot can be said about microcontrollers and systems that
            use these devices as they are everpresent in our day-to day life.
            Topics to be included: Understanding Microcontrollers

            &emsp;The focus of IO1 is to use this technology in flipped
            classrooms with groups of 15-30 students and create a set of
            resources with multiplication potential in other VET training
            centres. The leading organization for this output is MECB which
            boasts rich experience in creating electronic devices for current
            needs (eg. A special doll for autistic children). Companies will
            partner a VET school and thus provide the support needed for the
            implementation of designed projects. Schools have the possibility to
            organize the hands-on trainings and add methodological expertise to
            the tasks initiated by industry experts. Therefore LIIS will work
            with LUDOR, SFV with DANMAR and MECB with ALP on 3 devices each
            team, using embedded systems (microcontrollers). The companies will
            provide the data for the task and the schools will complete the
            projects and provide feedback on the activities. Each school will
            record videos, photos of the experimentations and document the
            obtained results. The Teams will work to create documentation that
            details the phase of design and contruction of 9 devices using
            microcontrollers. The documentation will be uploaded on the project
            site and the platform and represents the first module of the
            curricula.

            &emsp;Programing a microcontroller can be done with modern
            Integrated Development Environments (IDE) that use up-to-date
            languages, fully featured libraries that readily cover all of the
            most common actions, and several ready-made code examples to get the
            students started. Microcontrollers can be programmed in various
            high-level languages including C, C++, C#, Java, Python, .Net, and
            Basic. Development Boards are circuit boards that provide
            microcontroller chips with all the required supporting electronics
            (such as voltage regulator, oscillators, current limiting resistors,
            and USB plugs) required to operate. A microcontroller is an
            integrated chip in which we store the code which is written in an
            assemble language. Inserting the coded program into a
            microcontroller will require a device which is known as burner or
            programmer. A programmer is a hardware device with software which
            reads the content of the file is stored on a pc or laptop. In terms
            of innovation programming is the number one popularity trend for
            undergraduates. They all look for practical methods to exercise
            their skills. Therefore, starting elementary programming is
            advocated in all educational systems. However we lack both
            instruments and the methodology to encourage these activities in our
            VET institutes. Once the partnership will establish a successful
            educational model it could be adapted to the needs of other VET
            training institutes.

            &emsp;The Intellectual output is led by DANMAR who are experienced
            and have expertise in this field. Again the industry specialists
            will team with VET trainers and students and come up with
            programming solutions for the 3 devices created in IO1. The
            intellectual output is linked to IO1 as they are part of the
            curricula in three modules on the use of microcontroller application
            to foster technological skills in VET students. The teams will
            organize sessions in simulated work based environments and structure
            the documentation for the module based on flipped classroom
            experiences followed by a carefully monitored analysis. The
            documentation will include video, images, technical parametres for
            each of the VET schools, with the organisational support and insight
            from partner companies. UPT will monitor the quality management and
            check whether the skills stipulated in the documentation comply with
            both the level of expertise advocated by national curricula and the
            abilities required upon insertion on the labor market.

            &emsp;Once the modules from IO1 and IO2 are set they lead to the
            third chapter of the curricula which is the proper use of embedded
            systems to stimulate the development of scientific outputs and

            quickly with simple successes and dive deeper when their curiosity
            is engaged. Course discussions and assignments are designed to help
            educators plan for a successful STEM implementation in their
            classroom. The accompanying tutorials were written with high
            schoolers in mind and successfully used from middle school through
            universityÍ¾ discussion will include adapting for use with different
            grade levels. The curriculum will include contents that aim to
            develop STEM skills in students, examples of learning activities and
            evaluation methods. We mention a few useful themes for the
            development of STEM skills in students: -Adequate application of
            Maths, Physics and Chemistry typical for microcontroller
            applications. - Implementing practical tasks on electromagnetic
            conversion, electromagnetic phenomena, specific static convertors,
            electro-mechanics, electric equipments and electro-magnetic actions.
            - Exercising techniques for electric and non-electric measurements -
            Creating signal conditioning circuits - Types of microcontrollers -
            Microcontroller architecture and programming - Applying skills from
            Physics and Maths to power the microcontroller, intelligent
            integrated circuit display, applications with LED and relays, sound
            generators, display for an elevator, programmers for
            microcontrollers - Physical programming of microcontroller memory
            Themes will be established by all participants, after careful
            analysis of learning needs suggested by the two VET schools partner
            in the project. The partners will study documents on the STEM school
            curricula in every partner country participating in the project. The
            curriculum will be implemented as an integrated optional course at
            the level of the VET school, and also as extended curriculum for any
            of the STEM school subjects. The curricula is useful for anyone
            interested in the understanding of microcontroller functioning and
            the applications that can be created with their help.

            &emsp;Toolkit with curricular resources (contents, learning
            activities, evaluation instruments) is a long awaited product both
            by Stem teachers and by students. The science curricula in schools
            is not adapted to new developments in industry. STEM teachers need
            practical applications to develop in students the skills required on
            the labour market, due to the rapid evolution of new technologies.
            The robotisation of economic activities is a current theme on all
            markets in Europe, and on top of that it is even talk of the
            development of the 4.0 industry, and the connectiong of robots to
            other robots, etc. The educational models will be created for Maths,
            Physics, Chemistry, Sciences, but also for interdisciplinary and
            trans-disciplinary approaches. Through these educational models
            centered on practical activities, experiments and simulations
            student interest and motivation for the study of sciences will be
            boosted, developing their STEM skills and the transversal skills
            (collaborating in teams, self awareness and self control,
            creativity, active involvement, etc). These resources will also
            stimulate the desire to improve teacherâs teaching skills in STEM
            subjects and boost studentsâ drive towards sciences. STEM teachers
            and their students will have the opportunity to develop their
            entrepreneurial skills through access to new technologies,
            developing businesses that have as main object microcontroller
            applications.

            &emsp;With the feedback from the piloted curriculum the project
            partners can set out to design a toolkit which will include computer
            assisted lessons based on 21 didactic scenarios experimented in the
            3 partner schools. The Toolkit will act as a manual of useful
            practices drawing on the collective experience of the project. SVF
            will coordinate the achievement of this intellectual output and all
            partners will contribute to its completion. The partners will
            envisage didactic outlines for the curriculum themes to stimulate
            studentsâ interest for sciences and make them develop their STEM
            skills. All partners will agree on the structural elements of the
            resources and come up with ideas for computer assisted models. Each
            partner will suggest 3 didactic models totaling up to 21 models
            covering all the themes in the toolkit. Each model will contain all
            the elements needed by the teacher /trainer to organize a training
            activity for the students. UPT will evaluate the suggested
            educational models and will complement them with monitoring
            instruments for the activity of the students. Industry partners will
            comment on the models suggested and will add the practical dimension
            to the study with hands on exercising and practical participation of
            students in simulated learning situations that mirror
            microcontroller application activities developed in companies. VET
            schools after having implemented each 3 educational models, will
            fill in a journal with student feedback and evaluation from an
            expert that participated at the activity (teacher trainer,
            inspector, professor, company specialist, VET trainer).A collection
            of curricular resources (contents, learning activities, evaluation
            instruments) will be created to include the 21 educational models to
            develop STEM skills for VET students.
